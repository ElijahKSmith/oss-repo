# Lab 04 Report - Licensing

**3.** It is important to choose a license for two reasons. Firstly, to ensure that you recieve credit for the original or your derivation of work, because even open source code is not immune to being stolen. Second, to clear yourself of any liability should someone use or modify for harmful purposes. The purpose of the license is to protect yourself and your code while still ensuring that it meets open source standards and practices.

**4.** You shouldn't use a project that doesn't have an explicit license because the project owner may add another license to their project down the line that revokes your ability to use or modify the software. If that occurs and you do not have a previous fork of the project you will be forced to comply with the new license.

**5.** Based off of this reading, I think that Gopher did break the open system model by focusing too much on having their developers provide innovations to the protocol, servers software, etc. rather than letting the community help with those. To stick to the model, they should have released Gopher early in its development process in order to gain dedeicated followers that wanted to help make it better, including fixing any bugs that may have attributed to certain ways that Gopher was designed around. I, however, do not think that it was bad to have to pay a fee to use Gopher on .com domains and not .edu domains, because that's a logical next step in the development of software in order to ensure that developers will continue to maintain and innovate on it. People overreacted too much to this and the splintering from this is what killed the project.

**6.** The Linux kernel uses GPL v2 for several reasons. Firstly, as the kernel was adapted to move off of the original system that Linux Torvalds developed it for (called MINIX) and towards GNU applications, he was required by the GPL to change the license to the GPL licanse as per the provisions of the GPL license ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20070819045030/http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/old-versions/RELNOTES-0.12)). There were also many advocates that requested Linux switch over to GPL due to the provision in it to allow for it to be distributed for money. Today, the license is GPL v2, which Torvalds states he has no intention of upgrading to GPL v3 due to provisions that prohibit the use of the software in digital rights management and the impossibility to obtain permission from all copyright holders to update the license due to the thousands that there are ([source](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html#neutralizing-laws-that-prohibit-free-software-but-not-forbidding-drm)). Therefore, the choice of license for the Linux kernel at GPL v2 makes sense based of of the history and the purpose of the Linux project as well as the improbability to be able to change it in the future.
