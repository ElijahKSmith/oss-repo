**3.** It is important to choose a license for two reasons. Firstly, to ensure that you recieve credit for the original or your derivation of work, because even open source code is not immune to being stolen. Second, to clear yourself of any liability should someone use or modify for harmful purposes. The purpose of the license is to protect yourself and your code while still ensuring that it meets open source standards and practices.

**4.** You shouldn't use a project that doesn't have an explicit license because the project owner may add another license to their project down the line that revokes your ability to use or modify the software. If that occurs and you do not have a previous fork of the project you will be forced to comply with the new license.
