*It should be noted that this is not the full gource tree for this repo, as the full tree would take around 6 hours to generate at over 250GB of ppm footage.*

Gitstats differs from information obtained by looking at Github repository and running the `git ls-files -z | xargs -0 wc -l` command, number of contributors increased to 427 from 334, lines of code increased to 325628 from 48074.
