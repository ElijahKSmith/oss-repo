## Bio
![me_irl](images/lab-01/me.jpg)
I'm a man who wears many hats. One is as a Producer and former Head of Rules and Regulations for the [High School Esports League](https://hsel.org/), another is as the Vice President of the RPI League of Legends club. Most recently, I wear the hat of an RA for the E-Complex dorms. I'm a novice developer that's interested in learning how to be of value to the open source community. Favorite Linux distro is Arch (specifically Antergos), favorite text editor is VSCode.
