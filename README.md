## Bio
![me_irl](images/lab-01/me.jpg)

I'm a man who wears many hats. One is as the Vice President of the RPI League of Legends club, another as a volunteer moderator for the College League of Legends Officer Discord server. Most recently, I wear the hat of an RA for the E-Complex dorms. I'm a novice developer that's interested in learning how to be of value to the open source community. Favorite Linux distro is Kubuntu, favorite text editor is VSCode.
